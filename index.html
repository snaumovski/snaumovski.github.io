      title: "CROWD SPACE",
      description: `Work completed with KieranTimberlake

Crowd Space is an iterative virtual reality design tool/proof of concept that allows architects to design spaces in accordance with a real-time crowd simulation. With pre-loaded room types, a designer constructs a floor plate at a tabletop scale and then instantiates various agent types to interact with the newly created space. As a result of this immediate interaction, architects are able to design in a feedback loop while remaining immersed in the virtual environment.

The splash screen was procedurally generated with Grasshopper.`,

      title: "PHOTOBIOREACTOR",
      description: `"We believe that, if human beings are part of an ecology, then the objects humans make should also be part of it. Among humans and insects alike, inhabitable spaces are the result of a deliberate organization of material, energy, information and a continuous interaction with the environment, whose goal is to help develop tight-knit communities."

The purpose of this project is to design a photobioreactor in an urban environment for the production and consumption of future food - specifically the micro algae spirulina. The shape of the brain coral lends itself readily to the form of a tubular photobioreactor, with winding hills and valleys representing the tubes themselves. Brain Corals exist symbiotically with algae; the algae depends on the stony coral for structure while the coral depends on the algae for food.

A brain coral pattern can be generated using a couple of different algorithms, particularly through the concepts of reaction-diffusion and differential growth. Reaction-diffusion is pixel or grid based simulation that forms all at once, instead of gradually from an initial position â€“ which does not lend itself to the functionality of a tubular photobioreactor. Using the concept of linear differential growth, we were able to design a tube system that was at once continuous and variegated - in a controlled way.`,
