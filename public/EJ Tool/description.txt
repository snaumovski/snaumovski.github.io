In the US, minority and low-income populations experience a higher share of pollution risk due to land-use policies historically placing manufacturing plants in proximity to those populations. This concept is also known as environmental justice. To address this issue in the context of architectural practice, I contributed to the development of a proof-of-concept tool for daylighting the environmental justice factors of building products. By connecting BIM models to environmental impact and demographic data, architects can have an opportunity to evaluate building materials through an environmental justice lens. This work was presented at the Living Future 2023 Conference, the Design Modelling Symposium 2022, and the ACLCA 2022 Conference. To read the full paper, click this link.
