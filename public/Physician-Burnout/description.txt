Physician burnout in emergency medicine is a complex issue with multiple factors. Previous studies have linked emergency physician burnout to workplace conditions such as lack of respect from administrators and patients, too many bureaucratic tasks, lack of autonomy, and insufficient salary. However, the contribution of the emergency department (ED) environment itself to physician burnout has not been explicitly researched yet. To address this gap, I, along with my colleagues at KieranTimberlake, undertook a two-part study in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson University’s Health Design Lab and the Center for Immersive Media at the University of the Arts. We conducted interviews and surveys and collected commentary on Jefferson’s ED environment using high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) simulations.

By conducting a thematic analysis of the commentary data collected from the 19 physicians, we developed an environmental burnout model that placed environmental factors under one of three domains of burnout: (1) physical stress, (2) emotional stress, and (3) productivity stress. Sources of burnout within the built environment were often related to layout, acoustics, distance to patients, lack of natural lighting, lack of windows, and feelings of provider insecurity, all of which contribute to physical and emotional stress or the inability to do one’s job efficiently. Through a better understanding of these aspects of ED design, hospitals may be able to create better environments for physicians that will reduce burnout. This work was awarded a grant by the Emergency Medicine Foundation and HKS Architects and a manuscript for this study is planned to be completed this year. Preliminary results were published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.
