Work completed with KieranTimberlake.

Crowd Space is an iterative virtual reality design tool/proof of concept that allows architects to design spaces in accordance with a real-time crowd simulation. With pre-loaded room types, a designer constructs a floor plate at a tabletop scale and then instantiates various agent types to interact with the newly created space.  As a result of this immediate interaction, architects are able to design in a feedback loop while  remaining immersed in the virtual environment.
