For the design of the [Monarch Sanctuary](https://architizer.com/projects/monarch-sanctuary-integrated-biodiversity-in-double-skin-facade/), we created generative scripts based on real monarch butterfly activity.  We made our designs after reviewing the available monarch literature, and filling in the gaps by conducting our own in-house studies about the way monarchs latch onto surfaces, become attracted to objects, and are able to find food sources. The designs feature biomimetic concepts, including fibonacci spirals, algae growth patterns, and vein generation.
