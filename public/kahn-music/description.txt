This project is a mockup of a visual representation of a layered generative musical composition created for a composerâ€™s grant application. It was created using TouchDesigner with Ableton and ProTools. Maintaining the generative concept of the composition itself, the visuals were generated by the multi-layered composition (also a mockup in this video), in which each instrument jumps from score to score. Each instrument is represented by its own color and each score is represented by its own video file. The opacities of the colors and clips are generated by the loudness of a given instrument/score at that moment. The clips chosen, although relevant to the subject matter of the composition, Louis Kahn, act as placeholders for the time being.
