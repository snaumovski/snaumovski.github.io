The College of Built Environments (CBE) at the University of Washington faced the question: how is the built environment of the CBE contributing to student dissatisfaction? 
To answer this question, my colleagues and I facilitated a comprehensive engagement process to gather feedback from students, faculty, and staff at the CBE. Through thematic analysis, 
we identified environmental factors contributing to student dissatisfaction, synthesized community insights, and proposed a care-based framework for guiding future projects.

The thematic analysis revealed connections between factors of indignity and aspects of the built environment, such as the connection between a lack of flexible meeting and working spaces and a reduction in a sense of autonomy. We also found that the significant quantity of deferred maintenance at the CBE was a major contributing factor to feelings of indignity among students, faculty, and staff. These connections were then translated into a care-based framework for guiding projects and workstreams for the future CBE, and this work serves as a model for other colleges prioritizing building reuse, climate action, and equity. To date, two of the 25 projects that we proposed in our action plan are already underway.
